'domain_original.pddl' is the semantically more correct version, but we detected that POPCORN has a bag so it can't work on this domain. Instead, we modified the domain in a form where POPCORN can be run: 'domain.pddl'. 

the differences between two are:
original has start-end numeric change.
in original, all supply raw material actions are defined as one main action
original has two-typed predicates.

Random generator:
the random generator for 'domain_original.pddl' is 'gen_original'. for 'domain.pddl' it is 'gen'.
